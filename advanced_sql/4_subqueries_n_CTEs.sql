SUBQUERIES and CTEs

Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
Used for organizing and simplifying complex queries.
    - Helps break down queries into smaller, more manageable parts.
    - When to use one over the other?
        - Subqueries are for simplier queries
        - CTEs are for more complex queries

Subqueries -query nested inside a larger query
    - It can be used in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) -define a temporary result set that you can reference
    - Can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement
    - Defined with WITH

/*
Subqueries
- Subquery -query within another query 
- It can be used in several places in the main query
    Such as the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, or HAVING clauses
- It's executed first, and the results are passed to the outer query
- Can be used to filter, aggregate, or transform data before it's used in the main query
    It is used when you want to perform a calculation before the main query can complete its calculation

/*
CTEs
- CTE - A temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement
- Exists only during the execution of a query
- It's a defined query that can be referenced in the main query or other CTEs
- WITH -used to define CTE at the beginning of a query
